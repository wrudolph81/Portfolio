## Arts and Crafts and Digits and Electricity: Making in the Contemporary Era
---

### Thesis:

Art emerges from craft. The world would not stand as it does without the labor of people engaged in craft and the accrued skills that emerged from that labor. We are held up by the millions(billions?) of souls who have poured their labor and lives into cultivating their own knowledge and skills that they might be put to use in the present and presented to future generations to further grow and cultivate. This is perhaps a naive look on the evolution of society and world politics, but I think it something that has been present for all the time that we could say humanity has existed, a desire to grow, to know more, to be more.  We are at a terrifying and thrilling point on this millenia long ride. The layers of abstraction between us and the objects in our immediate surroundings is astounding. Few, perhaps no people could hope to fully understand the world we have discovered and put to use, to even comprehend its scope would be a hearty and ever evolving undertaking. I guess that just reinforces the beauty of community, the power of coming together in order to continue furthering our collective knowledge. I've learned so much over the years and am so grateful for all of the communities that have helped me to learn, to grow, and to further my understanding of myself and the world.
