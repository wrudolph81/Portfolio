### Greetings
  My name is Will Rudolph, I am currently teaching High School Engineering at Charlotte Latin School in Charlotte, North Carolina. When I'm not busy with work, I like to spend quality time with friends, learn new things about fabrication and electronics, design and create small projects, make experimental theatre, and much more.
