### Greetings
  My name is Will Rudolph, I am currently teaching High School Engineering at [Charlotte Latin School](https://www.charlottelatin.org/) in [Charlotte, North Carolina](https://www.google.com/maps?q=charlotte+north+carolina&rlz=1C1CHBF_enUS802US803&um=1&ie=UTF-8&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjAqsSr7MzmAhWDGs0KHddFAHkQ_AUoAXoECBQQAw). I also work maintaining and managing the [Fab Lab](https://www.fablabs.io/labs/fablabcharlottelatin) at the school. When I'm not busy with these responsibilities, I like to spend quality time with friends, learn new things about fabrication and electronics, design and create small projects, [make experimental theatre](https://www.instagram.com/xoxo.clt/), slackline, and much more.
