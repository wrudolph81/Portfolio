### Greetings
  My name is Will Rudolph, I am currently teaching High School Engineering at Charlotte Latin School in Charlotte, North Carolina. In my free time I like to spend quality time with friends, learn new things about fabrication and electronics, work on small projects, create experimental theatre and much more.
